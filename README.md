## Coronavirus? Social distancing? Oh no :'(

With the coronavirus in full stride and a social distancing mandate in effect, it's been
difficult to have physical contact with our friends and family.

## Hifiver is here to help!

Hifiver provides a means to get all the physical contact you've been looking for,
in a compact hand-shaped form.

Sometimes you need a good high five to lift your spirits. And now you can do just that!
